# Anglegram analysis: baseline code
This project is the implementation of the anglegram and the detection
of junctions in the boundary of a clump.
The algorithm detects junctions between the boundaries of overlapping
objects based on the angles between points of the overlapping
boundary.

The anglegram matrix is a 2D matrix with the multiscale angle variation.
The anglegram is used to find junctions of overlapping cells.
